bash-terminal-hipster
=====================

the title does not have three meanings

Are you reading this from a bash shell?  Do you wish you were?

If so, this is for you.

## what does it do?

Monitors your actions: notifies you with (not ironic) growl notifications when you could've done something without leaving your bash shell.

For example:

- you just hit Ctrl/Cmd+L and typed git client in your browser to search for git clients
"next time: just typed curl http://www.google.com?q=git+client"

## why?

A terminal hipster is someone taking the (forward) leap from the guis and window managers of yesteryear to the modern terminal.  That being said, we want to help make that translation as seamless as possible.  Also, we know you efficiency is important and want to help you maintain it, while you are learning how to improve it.

## coming soon

Mockups.  Once I figure out the color vertices and PNG encoding well enough to create them in vim.
